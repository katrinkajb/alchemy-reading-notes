# Chart.js API Article
    Goes over how to set up chart.js on your project. This would have been really nice to have read before yesterday's lab. I'll definitely be using this to get myself unstuck.

# Chart.js Docs
    These docs were very detailed, but useful to working through charts for lab 12

# Canvas API docs
    These docs detailed using the canvas element, which allow drawings. These went very in depth, but skimming them was useful and interesting to know.
