What's important in the articles below is the thinking behind breaking down the UI into pieces, or components.  "Components" can also mean a specific technical approach to doing so, like a React component or a Vanilla JS component.

# Applying Atomic Design
    Part 1 
        - To design, start big and work your way down.
        - Organisms - large sections that can be easily extracted from the page
        - Molecules - sections that can be easily extracted from Organisms. Usually repeated in mult places
        - Atoms - basic HTML elements(tags) that can't be broken down more without losing functionality
    Part 2
        -  After defining above items, define folder structure representing each atomic stage (atoms folder, molecules folder, organism folder)
        - To write the code, start small and build up. Make smaller components reusable. 'type' property can help (heading, subheading, or paragraph)
    More examples 
        - React is component-driven for UI development
        - Potential problems due to lack of governance:
            -  Re-creating stylesheets and patterns
            - Interfering styles when they come from different places cause devs to overuse CSS
            - styles coming from different places can break things on other pages without realizing it
        - Reusing component styles can help, but it can be hard to maintain
