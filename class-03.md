# HTML
    ## Ch3 “Lists” (pp.62-73)
        - Numbered (ol - li) (numbered or otherwise differentiated)
        - Bullet (ul - li) (bullets can be changed)
        - Definintion (dl - dt, dd) (words and definitions)
    ## Ch13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)
        - Size (width, height dimensions. These can be min/maxed too). Overflow can be hidden or scrolled for user experience.
        - Box model - border, margin(space between boxes), padding (space between element and border) can all be adjusted. 
        - Display and Visibility properties can be adjusted to show or hide boxes on the page and determine where on the page they will show.
        - Border can also have more properties like radius to round corners and shadows.

# JS
    ## Ch4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)
        - Switch Statements start with a switch value variable. Code runs until it hits a break vs if else where the whole thing runs regardless.
        - Type Coercion - JS will run even if it has an unexpected data type so it will convert it behind the scenes. 
        - Logical operators go left to right until they get a result and return the value that stopped them
        - Loops -> keyword (condition) {
            execution code
        }
            - For - when you need to run code a certain amount of times
            - While - run code until it meets a specific condition
            - Do While - same as While, but finishes the loop after meeting the condition.
