# What Google Learned About Teams
This article was really interesting and well written. I enjoyed reading about the research and findings, but I can't help but thing some parts are missing from this research, maybe because of the time it was completed. I'd love to see this type of research being combined with DE&I research. I fear that some studies like this focus on teams that are fairly homogenous in terms of gender, race/ethnicity, lgbtq status, age, neuro-status, etc. and so I wonder if what works for a group of primarily straight white men in their late 20's/early 30's is wildly different from a diverse group. Interesting to think about for sure.
