    -Controlling position of elements
        -Blocks - can be box-level on their own line, or inline to share a line together. Can be nested inside other blocks
        -Positioning
            -Normal flow means everything is on its own line
            -Relative Positioning moves a block relative to where it would've been with normal flow
            -Absolute positioning places the block in relation to its container
        Box Offset
            -Fixed positioning - blocks stay where they are in the browser window and don't move on scroll

            z-index - which box shows on top

# JS
## Ch3 (first part): “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.86-99 ONLY)
    -Functions & Methods
        Function: group of statements that performs a task
            function NAME() {
                code block of what to do;
            }
            -To call function just use NAME();
            -Some functions need info to run, this lives in the parenths and must be given when calling the function
            - to get multiple values out of a function use [] after the parenths and say which position you want to get.
            -Can also use anon functions by just calling them 'function'

# Article: “6 Reasons for Pair Programming”
    I thought this article was interesting and really rang true after working on today's lab. It felt like we were more efficient and were better able to solve problems before bringing in a TA when we discussed together. I definitely felt confidence boosting when I found a new way to do something that I learned from my partner. 
    -Why?
        -Greater efficiency
        -Engaged collab (boost confidence)
        -Learning from fellow students
        -Social skills
        -Job interview readiness
        -Work environment readiness
