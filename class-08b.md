# HTML
    - Ch15, “Layout” (again; repeat of Class 4 reading)
        - Controlling position of elements
        - Blocks - can be box-level on their own line, or inline to share a line together. Can be nested inside other blocks
        - Positioning
            - Normal flow means everything is on its own line
            - Relative Positioning moves a block relative to where it would've been with normal flow
            - Absolute positioning places the block in relation to its container
        - Box Offset
            - Fixed positioning - blocks stay where they are in the browser window and don't move on scroll
            - Floating - block makes its own element that other things can go around
            - z-index - which box shows on top
