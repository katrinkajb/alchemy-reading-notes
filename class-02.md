# HTML/CSS
    ## Ch2 
        Text can be changed with structural or semantic markup tags that can turn things bold/strong, italicized/em, sub and superscript, quotations, etc as well as add bits between the text like white space, line breaks, and horizontal rules.
    ## Ch10 (pp.226-245)
        - CSS changes the style the hrml takes on a page by creating rules on the individual block elements
        - Rules are set up like this: selector {
            declaration (aka property: value);
        }
        - Selectors determine where the styling goes on the doc and the rules cascade down from there. If another rule contradict, the last rule is the one that takes effect.
# JS
    ## Ch2 (pp.53-84)
        - Declare variables with keywords and names. Then you can add values and attributes. Values can be numbers, strings, or booleans. They can also be arrays (lists of things).
        - Expressions do things to variables (assign values, use them to find other values, etc).
        - Operators create a single value from one or more values
    ## Ch4 (only up to the section on switch statements) (pp.145-162)
        - Flowcharts help plan for when decisions need to be made in a script and what code to run after these decisions.
        - Decisions are made by evaluations. Evals are made of an expression (which is evaluated and returns a value) and a conditional statement (that says what to do). if/else statements. Certain operators help do to this (===, !==, <, >, <=, >=). Logical operators like && (and), || (or), and ! (not) allow you to compare more than one comparison operator.
