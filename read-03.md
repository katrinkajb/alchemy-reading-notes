    ## Shay Howeâ€™s intro to RWD 
        - a site that will adjust to mobile - flexible layout
        - Using flexible grids means using relative length units (% or em units)
            - vw (viewports width)
            - vh (viewports height)
            - vmin (min of viewport's height and width)
            - vmax (max of viewport's height and width)
        - Take target width of element and divide by width of parent element for the relative width.
        - Can also use min-width, max-width, min-height, and max-height properties
        - Media Query - Ability to specify different styles for different browser/devices
        - Orientation - landscape or portrait
        - Aspect Ratio width/height (eg x/y)
        - Mobile-first means loading is quicker on mobile since it doesn't have to load the full site first, then override those styles with mobile styles
        - Viewport meta tag helps scale things on a smaller screen (like buttons and button text)
            - minimum-scale, maximum-scale, initial-scale(almost always set to 1), user-scalable properties
