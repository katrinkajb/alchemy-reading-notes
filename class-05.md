    ## Ch5: “Images” (pp.94-125)
        - How <img> tag can contain additional info: src for the url, alt for descriptions for vision impaired, title for hover. Height and width can also be added to specify size. 
        - Where you put the image in regards to the other code will determine where it is displayed, but you can use align to determine how it interacts with other elements around it. Left, right, top, middle, bottom can all be used here.
        - Choosing Format - aim for jpeg, gif, or png (bitmap images) for most websites. Aim to save the image at the same size you intend to use it at so it doesn't take up too much space, but still has the correct shape. Save resolution is where you want it to save space/loading time. Online Editors can help get images right before adding them to your site.
            - JPEG - use for logs of colors
            - GIF and PNG - for images with few colors or large areas of the same color
        - Image size - Changing shape and size can alter the quality of the image. Images for web should be at least 72 ppi (resolution) to appear correctly on the page. 
            - Vector images - resolution independent, created in programs like Illustrator. Allows size changing without affecting quality.
            - Animated gifs - better for small illustrations rather than photographs
        - Transparency - Transparent gif (of it has straight edges and is 100% transparent) or png (if it has diagonal or rounded edges or semi-opaque).
        - Figures and Fig captions. Caption included with image on screen.
